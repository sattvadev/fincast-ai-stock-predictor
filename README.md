The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains all the frontend React application code, including pages, components, hooks, and styles.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code, built with Hono. This is where API routes are defined.
-   `shared/`: Contains shared TypeScript types used by both the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.

## 🔧 Development

-   **Frontend**: All frontend components are located in `src/components`. The main application view is `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`.
-   **Backend**: API endpoints are defined in `worker/user-routes.ts`. You can add or modify routes here.
-   **Styling**: The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the theme in `tailwind.config.js` and global styles in `src/index.css`.

## ☁️ Deployment
